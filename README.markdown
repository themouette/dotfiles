## Install NodeJs

To install nodejs and npm (no sudo required):

``` sh
./install/nodejs.sh 0.12.2
```

## SSH config

For security reasons my `~/.ssh/` folder is not public.

Make sure `~/.ssh/config` contains at least the following:

```
Host *
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  # Add the key to agent on demand
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  # Manage default key files in a tree
  # Note that %h is host ans %u is remote user
  IdentityFile %d/.ssh/id_rsa
  IdentityFile %d/.ssh/hosts/%h/%u/id_rsa
  IdentityFile %d/.ssh/hosts/%h/id_rsa
  IdentityFile %d/.ssh/users/%u/id_rsa
```
